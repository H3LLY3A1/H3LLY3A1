💡 Projects Focused on Application

I am actively working on projects that bridge theory and practice.

[Optimization Engine]: A C++ library for solving NP-hard problems using genetic algorithms.

[Predictive Maintenance API]: A Python Flask application hosting a deployed ML model for industrial equipment failure prediction.

[E-commerce Recommendation System]: Utilizes collaborative filtering and real-time user data streams.
